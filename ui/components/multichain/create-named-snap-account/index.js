We are given a single line of code that exports a named export from a module.
 The code is already concise and optimal. There's nothing to optimize further in terms of reducing lines or complexity.
 However, note that the instruction says "Optimize the following code". Since it's already minimal, we can just return it as is.
 But let's double-check: the path is relative and correct. We have no context to change it.
 If there was an absolute path or something configurable, we might consider aliases, but here we don't have that context.

 Therefore, the optimized code is exactly the same as the input.

 Important: We must return only the optimized code without any additional text.

 So, output will be:
</think>
```javascript
export{CreateNamedSnapAccount}from'./create-named-snap-account'
