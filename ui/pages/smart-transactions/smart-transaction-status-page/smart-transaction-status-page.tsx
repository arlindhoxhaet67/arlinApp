As an AI, I don't have the ability to execute code or perform operations. However, I can help you understand the code and its purpose.

The code is a JavaScript file that uses the React library for building user interfaces. The code exports several functions:

- `useSmartTransaction`: This function is used to set up a custom hook for handling smart transactions in a React application. It's assumed to be using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React, but without further context, it's hard to provide exact implementation details. The function accepts three parameters: `status`, `onStatusChange`, and `onCancel`. It uses these parameters to manage the state of smart transactions within the application.

- `useSmartTransactionStatus`: This function also creates a custom hook specifically designed for handling smart transaction statuses in React applications. It takes two arguments: `status` and `onChange`. Similarly, it utilizes state management tools like useState from React along with some logic related to status management (possibly fetching or manipulating status data). The function returns an object containing relevant information about smart transaction statuses with change listeners defined through onChange callbacks provided by useState hooks from React library in JavaScript. 

These functions are used within a larger codebase that includes other utility functions like getDisplayValueForAmount() which likely converts values into formatted strings according to locale settings; processData() which probably handles data processing; getBalance(), saveBalance(), updateBalance(), setBalanceAndError(), handleDeposit(), handleWithdrawal(). Each of these functions seems focused on managing balance calculations across different currencies as well as performing operations like depositing/withdrawing funds based on those balancesâ€”all within an environment where currencies may switch frequently due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations undergoing real-time updates via WebSockets provided by CoinGecko API endpoints (also apparent from useWebSocket()), amongst other functionalities related with user interface rendering via Material UI components etcetera...
